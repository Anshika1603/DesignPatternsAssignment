# DesignPatternsAssignment

1. Create a Builder class for a Pizza object that allows the user to specify the size, crust type, sauce type, and toppings. Demonstrate how to use the Builder class to create a Pizza object.
2. Create a Logger class that logs messages to a file. Implement the Singleton design pattern with eager initialization to ensure that only one instance of the Logger class is created, regardless       of how many times it is requested.
3. Create a Shape interface with a method called draw that prints the shape name. Implement three classes that implement the Shape interface: Circle, Rectangle, and Square.
    Create a ShapeFactory class that has a method called getShape that takes a string as input and returns a Shape object based on the input string. If the input string is "Circle", return a Circle     object. If the input string is "Rectangle", return a Rectangle object. If the input string is "Square", return a Square object. If the input string is not recognized, return null.
    Use the ShapeFactory class to create at least three different Shape objects and call their draw method to print their name.
